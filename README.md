### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is JOHNfreedom1234, I'm... an autistic programmer, who doesn't do that much programmaing, but does love to write.

Okay, now that that's over with, I'm a CS student with an interest in programmer and a passion for all things tech and science. I also write on the side, though that seems to be my main gig nowadays
